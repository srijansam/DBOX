Project Title: Multi-User Donation Platform

Project Description:

This web-based donation platform is designed to create a seamless and efficient way to connect donors with NGOs while ensuring transparency and effective communication among users. The website features three distinct roles: User, NGO, and Admin, each with tailored functionalities to enhance the donation experience.

User Functionality:

Users can register or log in to their account and browse a variety of donation options such as monetary donations, food, clothes, books, or other essentials.
A user-friendly donation form allows donors to specify their contributions, including quantity, condition (if applicable), and any additional details.
Once a donation is submitted, users can track the status of their donation and receive updates from NGOs.
NGO Functionality:

NGOs can log in to access a curated list of donations made by users.
The platform allows NGOs to view details of the donations and choose the ones most suitable for their cause.
NGOs can directly communicate with donors by sending personalized messages to acknowledge their generosity or arrange for the collection/delivery of the donation.
Admin Functionality:

Admins have comprehensive access to the entire system, including user profiles, NGO accounts, and all donations made.
Admins oversee the platform's operations to ensure authenticity, manage conflicts, and monitor user interactions.
The admin dashboard provides analytics on donation trends, user engagement, and NGO activity, enabling continuous improvement of the platform.
Key Features:

User-Centric Design: Intuitive interfaces for each role, ensuring ease of use and accessibility for all participants.
Seamless Communication: Built-in messaging system between users and NGOs fosters direct interaction and builds trust.
